# This is my personal website project! Serves as an online portfolio, and is a constant work-in-progress.
# Used CSS Flexbox, Animations, Transitions, jQuery, JavaScript, and HTML to make it!
# Future features (coming soon!): more fade-in transitions and modern design elements, a blog section, a form section that sends messages to my email, and more visualizations of my projects!
